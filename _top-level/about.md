## Family

Joe Hendrix lives with his wife of over three years, their rambunctious almost-three-year-old son, their just-starting-walking one-year-old daughter, and their two dogs Princess & Niko.

## Faith

Baptized in the Lutheran tradition, Joe converted to Catholicism as an adult. Before COVID-19, Joe and his family attended weekly mass at [St. Peter's here in Huber Heights](https://daytonxii.org/saint-peter-parish/). Now they watch the [mass on YouTube Sunday mornings](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD7S39YwDMmAuuEyE1tGkyQ/) together, but are anxious to get back to attending in person.

## Day Job

Joe works as a software engineer at Northrop Grumman - sometimes on base at Wright-Patt, sometimes at the office in Beavercreek, but mostly at home since COVID-19 started.
