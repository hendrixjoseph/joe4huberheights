title: Campaign Strategy Overview - My Facebook Strategy
---

In my last post, I talked about how [my strategy behind this website](
https://www.joe4huberheights.com/choosing-this-website/). Now I want to discuss the strategy behind my Facebook page.

I created my Facebook page on February 23, 2021. Honestly, I should have created it much sooner than that - a year earlier, perhaps, when I [interviewed for the open Ward 3 council position](https://www.joe4huberheights.com/huber-heights-ward-3-council-member-interview/).

The name of my Facebook page was *Joseph Hendrix, Candidate for Ward 3, Huber Heights* - my name first, then what I was running for. I felt that name recognition was more important than the position, at least when getting things in front of people's eyes.

The URL is important, too. The Facebook URL is <https://www.facebook.com/Joe4HuberHeights/>, which mirrors the domain of this website (<https://www.joe4huberheights.com>). This reduces any "cognitive load" (that is, how hard someone has to think) for anyone to distinguish between the two.

## Events

https://www.facebook.com/Joe4HuberHeights/events/

Part of my Facebook strategy was to have two events - namely, the [Deadline for Voter Registration for the May 4 Primary Election](https://www.facebook.com/events/756389345017676/) on April 5, 2021, and [Primary Election Day](https://www.facebook.com/events/554406715939214/) on May 4, 2021. This allowed me to share these two very important happenings, and have my page attached to them.

I also made sure to put my [Huber Heights Community Cleanup](https://www.facebook.com/events/2752105881771805/) as a Facebook event. This event was also [posted on this website](https://www.joe4huberheights.com/huber-heights-community-cleanup/) as well as plenty of other places.

## Ads

I created two ads - one ad for the *Deadline for Voter Registration for the May 4 Primary Election* and one for the *Primary Election Day*. You can see a summary of these events in [Facebook's Ad Library](https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?id=1619605648232044). (Note that the Ad Library shows three events - two of which are for the *Primary Election Day* event. I made a few mistakes with one of them and the ad never ran.)

What's interesting about these ads - since I was running an ad that was aimed at affecting an election, I had to get approved. This involved Facebook snail-mailing me a code to my address, which I then had to enter on Facebook. I also had to name the committee that I created for my campaign (that committee being *Citizens for Joseph Hendrix*).

### The Audience

With Facebook, you can specify an audience. Sometimes, this audience is based on interest, such as *dogs*, or job title, such as *software engineer*. You can also specify an audience by geography - such as country, state, or even city.

I got a little more specific than even city. I live pretty central to my ward, so I narrowed down the audience to anyone within one mile of my address.

### The Cost

I spent $20 on each ad - $40 total. You can see both of these expenses on the [expenses section of this website](https://www.joe4huberheights.com/expenses/).

### The Results

Here are the raw numbers for the results from each ad:

#### Deadline for Voter Registration for the May 4 Primary Election

* Event Response: 2
* Reach: 614
* Post Engagement: 19
* Link Clicks: 13

## Sharing to Groups

I also shared my events and other posts to local Facebook groups.

These groups were:

* [Everything Huber Heights!](https://www.facebook.com/groups/424944654277713/)
* [Brick City Town Hall](https://www.facebook.com/groups/707953565979489/)
* [Huber Heights Town Hall](https://www.facebook.com/groups/445365902461632)

They're private groups so you may not be able to see what's happening if your not a member.

But what was great about sharing to these groups was that my posts got more exposure and views - for free! - than from paying for ads.

## Watching Other Pages

One this Facebook allows pages to do is watch up to five other pages.

Of course, I decided to watch the page of one of my opponents - [Frank Wylie](https://www.facebook.com/Wylie-for-Ward-3-181069790116418). My other opponent - [Kathleen Baker](https://www.hhoh.org/354/Kathleen-Baker), the incumbent - doesn't appear to have a Facebook page.

Does that mean I left the remaining four spots unwatched? Absolutely not! It just so happens that in this election cycle, there was a three-way race for mayor. So I watched each of the mayoral candidate's Facebook pages:

* [Jeff Gore](https://www.facebook.com/HuberHeightsMayor), the incumbent
* [Glenn Otto](https://www.facebook.com/ottoformayor)
* [Ed Lyons](https://www.facebook.com/EdLyonsforMayor)

{% include image.html src="/images/facebook-strategy/pages-watched.png" caption="The Pages to Watch section, showing that I'm more popular than Ed Lyons but less popular than everyone else." %}

## Aftermath

With the primary election, only two people could continue to the general election.

I came in third, so I renamed the page to *Joseph Hendrix, Huber Heights Ward 3 Resident*. Fun fact: Facebook had to approve the name change, although they did so almost instantly.

I've yet to change my header image - I will as soon as I think of something. But I will continue to share my thought on this page, and share things on my Facebook page as well.
