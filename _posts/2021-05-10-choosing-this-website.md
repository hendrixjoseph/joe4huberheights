title: Campaign Strategy Overview - Choosing This Website
---

In my [last post](https://www.joe4huberheights.com/2021-huber-heights-primary-results/), I mentioned that I would be discussing some of the strategies I took in promoting my campaign for Huber Heights Ward 3 Council. I figured the best place to start explaining is this website.

## The Domain

Why did I choose *joe4huberheights.com*? Most importantly, *because it was available*.

But I also chose a dot-com extension versus the [hundreds of top-level domains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_top-level_domains) available because it is the most familiar to people.

And the *4* between my name and the city's name helps break up the words so that it's easier to read.

Now, I suppose I had a choice between *joe4huberheights* and *huberheights4joe*, but I felt it more appropriate that I was running for the benefit of Huber Heights, not that Huber Heights existed for the benefit of me.

I could have also used my full name - perhaps *joehendrix4huberheights* or even *josephhendrix4huberheights*, but that's getting a bit long-winded. Plus, using just the simple nickname version of my first name seems much more personable.

And there's the nickname I use across the Internet - JoeHx. A [Google search for JoeHx](https://www.google.com/search?q=joehx) or even an [Amazon search for JoeHx](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=joehx) shows a bunch of the crazy stuff I've been up to.

But I was running not as my Internet persona, but as a citizen of Huber Heights. Besides, *joe4huberheights* is easier to remember than *joehx4huberheights*.

So [joe4huberheights.com](https://www.joe4huberheights.com/) it is.

## Completely On My Own

I didn't pay anyone to create this site. I wrote it all on my own. All I paid was $12 to [Google for the domain](https://domains.google/). Head on over to the [expenses section of this website](https://www.joe4huberheights.com/expenses/) and all you'll see regarding this website is the $12 transaction to Google on February 17th.

Hosting is free. How? Via [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/). This is actually the fourth site I've made with GitHub pages. The other three are:

* [JoeHx Blog](https://www.joehxblog.com/)
* [Puppy Snuggles](https://www.puppy-snuggles.com/)
* [Microwave Cooking Times](https://www.microwavecookingtimes.com/)

The latter two have been a bit neglected; I blog semi-regularly (mostly on money and technical topics) on the first.

If you want the technical details, GitHub Pages uses a static blog generator known as [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). But once it reaches you, it's all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I use very little JavaScript on this site. The only bit I do use is for Google Analytics, so I know how much traffic this site gets.

If you want to view the "backend" of this site, it's [publicly available on GitHub](https://github.com/hendrixjoseph/joe4huberheights).

## The Styling

Or, why yellow?

Yellow because it's my favorite color. And yellow is my favorite color because it's my mom's favorite color. And because most people's favorite color *is not* yellow (most people's favorite color is blue).

Yellow, along with purple, is also a libertarian color. As stated in the [FAQ](https://www.joe4huberheights.com/faq/), I'm a libertarian.

I could have used purple instead of the black, but I felt that black contrasted better than purple.

The design - my name in yellow text surrounded by a black box with the remaining text in black with the yellow background - is mostly based on a political yard sign I saw online. I just liked how it looked.

## Submitting to Indexes

For the most part, you never need to submit a site to indexes (like Google, Yahoo!, and Bing?). They'll find you.

But there are a few places I make sure have my site indexed. And making sure it's indexed is as simple as searching for my site on the indexer site.

Here are the index sites I submit a brand new site to:

* [Alexa.com](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/joe4huberheights.com)
* [Netcraft Site Report](https://sitereport.netcraft.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.joe4huberheights.com%2F)
* [Moz Link Explorer](https://moz.com/link-explorer)

I also set up a [Google Webmasters/Google Search Console](https://www.google.com/intl/en/webmasters/) property for the domain.

## Getting Backlinks

Most reading this won't know what *backlinks* are. You probably do know what *links* are.

Links are that bit of blue text that you click on that takes you to another page.

A *backlink* is a special type of link that takes you from one domain to another.

For instance, if I link to [google.com](https://www.google.com/), that link in this sentence is a backlink to Google from this site.

Backlinks are the core of how Google ranks pages - the more backlinks, the more likely a site will appear on their results page (note: a lot has changed since Google first started doing this, but this is a simplified explanation).

So, I mentioned this campaign site on at least two posts on my regular blog:

* [February 2021 Blog Statistics](https://www.joehxblog.com/february-2021-blog-statistics/)
* [April 2021 Blog Statistics](https://www.joehxblog.com/april-2021-blog-statistics/)

I also answered as many requests for candidate information as I could. This netted me a [backlink from WDTN.com](https://www.wdtn.com/news/yleh-candidate-profiles/huber-heights-city-council-ward-3-joseph-hendrix/). I also have [a backlink from Vote-USA.org](https://vote-usa.org/Intro.aspx?State=OH&Id=OHHENDRIXJOSEPH).

I also filled out [my profile on a wiki known as LPedia](https://lpedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Hendrix).

Finally, I submit these various blog posts to [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/domain/joe4huberheights.com/) (mostly on [my profile](https://www.reddit.com/user/joehx/) to avoid spam issues), [Mix.com](https://mix.com/search/joe4huberheights.com/domain), and [Muck Rack](https://muckrack.com/search/).

## Additionally

I make sure the entire site is archived on the [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/), as well as process each blog post through [Facebook's Sharing Debugger](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/) and [Twitter's Card Validator](https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator).

That's it for today. Next time, I'll think I'll talk about my Facebook strategy, and why I didn't set up a Twitter campaign account.
