title: Ward 3 Walks - Literally Running for Council
---

As part of my campaign for Ward 3 in Huber Heights, I have a goal of running/walking on every street in Ward 3.

So far, I've walked/run on the following streets:

* Harshmanville Rd between Taylorsville Rd & Longford Road
* Larcomb Dr betwen Harshmanville Rd & Montague Rd
* Leawood Dr between Harshmanville Rd & Montague Rd
* Longford Rd between Harshmanville Rd & Montague Rd
* All of Montague Rd
* All of Kingsbury Dr
* Kylemore Dr between Kingsbury Dr & Montague Rd
* Taylorsville Rd between Harshmanville Rd & Old Troy Pike
* All of Mt Ranier
* Mt Hood between Taylorsville Rd & Pomeranian Dr
* All of Mt Whitney
* All of Calmcrest Ct
* All of Charmwood Dr
* All of Corlett Ct
* All of Camrose Ct
* All of Craigmont Ct
* Troy Manor between Charmwood Dr & Taylorsville Rd

I've also run at Gary Sherman Park behind the police station (and Shullgate Park but that's in Ward 2).

...I need to compile a list of the streets so I can check them off.

I also am bringing a plastic grocery bag with me to pick up litter towards the end of my run.
