title: 2021 Huber Heights Ward 3 Primary Results
---

The results are in, and I am out. But that doesn't mean I'm going anywhere.

Frank Wylie and Kate Baker are going on to compete in the general election. I will be transitioning this website and my Facebook page into a citizen page.

If you're curious about the results, here are the numbers:

candidate|votes|%
---|---|---
Kate Baker|239|63.9
Frank Wylie|72|19.3
Joseph Hendrix|63|16.8
total|374|100

These numbers are available on [WDTN's site](https://www.wdtn.com/montgomery-county/) as well as the [Montgomery County Board of Elections site](https://www.montgomery.boe.ohio.gov/results/).

If you want deeper analysis, head on over to this [Montgomery County Election Night Results page](https://montgomeryoh.electionnightresults.com/) or look at this [results.txt file](https://data.electionnightresults.com/montgomeryoh/results/results.txt).
