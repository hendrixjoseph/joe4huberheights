title: Is It Normal for Cities to be Members of Their Respective Chamber of Commerce?
---

Since the City of Huber Heights is not a member of its respective chamber of commerce, I was curious if it was "normal" for cities to be members of their respective chambers.

So I looked at a few neighboring cities and found that, yes, it is normal for cities to be members of their chambers of commerce. Granted, I didn't look at every city that exists, so this is 

Here are the Cities that are members of their Chamber:

* The City of Riverside is a member of the [Riverside Area Chamber of Commerce](https://www.riversidechamber.com/membershipdashlist2)
* The [Kettering Moraine Oakwood Chamber](http://www.kmo-coc.org/) has all three cities as members:
  * [The City of Kettering](http://www.kmo-coc.org/list/member/city-of-kettering-139)
  * [The City of Moraine](http://www.kmo-coc.org/list/member/city-of-moraine-moraine-141)
  * [The City of Oakwood](http://www.kmo-coc.org/list/member/city-of-oakwood-oakwood-142)
  * Heck, [Oakwood City Council](http://www.kmo-coc.org/list/member/oakwood-city-council-586) is a member.
* Both the township and city are members of the [Vandalia Butler Chamber of Commerce](https://www.vandaliabutlerchamber.org/):
  * [Butler Township](https://business.vandaliabutlerchamber.org/list/member/butler-township-49)
  * [The City of Vandalia](https://business.vandaliabutlerchamber.org/list/member/city-of-vandalia-61)
* The City of Trotwood is a member of the [Trotwood Chamber of Commerce](https://www.trotwoodchamber.org/).

Yes, the [City of Dayton](https://daytonareachamberofcommerce.growthzoneapp.com/activememberdirectory/Details/city-of-dayton-147541) is a member of the [Dayton Area Chamber of Commerce](https://daytonchamber.org/)

Interestingly enough, so is [Huber Heights](https://daytonareachamberofcommerce.growthzoneapp.com/activememberdirectory/Details/city-of-huber-heights-1338395), along with the following cities:
