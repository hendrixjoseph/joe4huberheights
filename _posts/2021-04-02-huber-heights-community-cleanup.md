title: Huber Heights Community Cleanup
---

My campaign has two goals: Improve Myself, and Improve Huber Heights. Win or lose, if my campaign does not meet those two goals, than my campaign has failed.

That's why, as part of a campaign event, I'm hosting a Community Cleanup on Saturday, April 10th starting at 10 am.

The goal for this event will be to pick up litter in a given area - and the area I've chosen for this cleanup is the Kroger/Rural King parking lot (Waynetowne Plaza) along Old Troy Pike.

Trash bags, gloves, hand sanitizer, and bottled water will be provided. Feel free to bring your own gloves if you have a favorite pair.

* **Time:** 10:00am - 11:00am
