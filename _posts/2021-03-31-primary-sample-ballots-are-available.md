One of the best ways to be informed about what's going to be on the ballot is to head on over to the [Ohio Board of Elections sample ballot site](https://lookup.boe.ohio.gov/vtrapp/montgomery/ballotlist.aspx).

No matter your ward - or even if you happen to live outside of Huber Heights and happened across this post by accident - you can view what will be on your ballot on any upcoming election before you vote.

**Hint:** After clicking the "Find Ballots" button, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>F</kbd> on your keyboard and enter "Huber" in the search box to quickly jump down to the Huber Heights sample ballots.

There are even sample ballots going back to 2014 (if you want to look)!

I looked at all four sample ballots for Ward 3, and they're all the same.

Here's the sample ballot for my precinct (Huber Heights 3-C):
